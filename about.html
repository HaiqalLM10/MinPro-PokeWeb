                    Pokémon executive director Satoshi Tajiri first thought of Pokémon, albeit with a different
                    concept and name, around 1989, when the Game Boy was released. The concept of the Pokémon
                    universe, in both the video games and the general fictional world of Pokémon, stems from the
                    hobby of insect collecting, a popular pastime which Tajiri enjoyed as a child. Players
                    are designated as Pokémon Trainers and have three general goals: to complete the regional
                    Pokédex by collecting all of the available Pokémon species found in the fictional region
                    where a game takes place, to complete the national Pokédex by transferring Pokémon from
                    other regions.

                <p>The Pokémon Company International, a subsidiary of The Pokémon Company in Japan, manages the property
                    outside of Asia and is responsible for brand management, licensing, marketing, the Pokémon Trading
                    Card Game, the animated TV series, home entertainment, and the official Pokémon website. Pokémon was
                    launched in Japan in 1996 and today is one of the most popular children's entertainment properties
                    in the world.

                    Pokémon is set in the fictional Pokemon universe. There are numerous regions that have appeared in
                    the various media of the Pokémon franchise. There are 8 main series regions set in the main series
                    games: Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh/Hisui, Unova, Kalos, Alola, and Galar. Each of the eight
                    generations of the main series releases focuses on a new region. Every region consists of several
                    cities and towns that the player must explore in order to overcome many waiting challenges, such as
                    Gyms, Contests and villainous teams. At different locations within each region, the player can find
                    different types of Pokémon, as well as helpful items and characters. Different regions are not
                    accessible from one another at all within a single game, only with the exception of Kanto and Johto
                    being linked together in Pokémon Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold and SoulSilver versions. There are
                    also regions set in spinoff games and two islands in the Pokémon anime (Orange Islands and Decolore
                    Islands), all still set within the same fictional universe.Each main series region in the Pokémon
                    universe is based on a real world location. The first 4
                    introduced regions (Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh/Hisui) are based on parts of Japan, with later
                    regions being based on parts of the United States (New York City is Unova and Hawaii is Alola),
                    France (Kalos), the United Kingdom (Galar), and Spain and Portugal (generation 9 region).

                    Pokémon has been criticized by some fundamentalist Christians over perceived occult and violent
                    themes and the concept of "Pokémon evolution", which they feel goes against the Biblical creation
                    account in Genesis. Sat2000, a satellite television station based in Vatican City, has countered
                    that the Pokémon Trading Card Game and video games are "full of inventive imagination" and have no
                    "harmful moral side effects".In the United Kingdom, the "Christian Power Cards" game was
                    introduced in 1999 by David Tate who stated, "Some people aren't happy with Pokémon and want an
                    alternative, others just want Christian games." The game was similar to the Pokémon Trading Card
                    Game but used Biblical figures.

                    In 1999, Nintendo stopped manufacturing the Japanese version of the "Koga's Ninja Trick" trading
                    card because it depicted a manji, a traditionally Buddhist symbol with no negative connotations. The
                    Jewish civil rights group Anti-Defamation League complained because the symbol is the reverse of a
                    swastika, a Nazi symbol. The cards were intended for sale in Japan only, but the popularity of
                    Pokémon led to import into the United States with approval from Nintendo. The Anti-Defamation League
                    understood that the portrayed symbol was not intended to offend and acknowledged the sensitivity
                    that Nintendo showed by removing the product.

                    In 1999, two nine-year-old boys from Merrick, New York, sued Nintendo because they claimed the
                    Pokémon Trading Card Game caused their problematic gambling.

                    In 2001, Saudi Arabia banned Pokémon games and the trading cards, alleging that the franchise
                    promoted Zionism by displaying the Star of David in the trading cards (the Colorless energy from the
                    Pokémon Trading Card Game resembles a six-pointed star) as well as other religious symbols such as
                    crosses they associated with Christianity and triangles they associated with Freemasonry; the games
                    also involved gambling, which is in violation of Muslim doctrine.Pokémon has also been accused of
                    promoting materialism.
